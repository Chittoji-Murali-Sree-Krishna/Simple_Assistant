# java script
just a basic voice assistant with very few operations using javascript and it will only work on few browsers, if using this in linux please check wheter you can access the microphone or not , in some linux distros , due to pulse audio isuues it cant be able to access the microphone

# python
it does require few pip packages to run and most probably u need to check wheter the microphone is working or not if it's not working, then the code will not work check for that
